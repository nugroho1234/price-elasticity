# Project Description
A data science project focusing on creating a price elasticity model using TensorFlow.

# Installation
Clone this repo: https://github.com/nugroho1234/price-elasticity

Please take a look at the requirements.txt to see the libraries I use.

# Project Motivation
Having worked in a social-commerce startup for the past 3 years, I realize that price is one of the biggest factors influencing customers' buying decisions. Especially, when the products are not branded, and the target market is sensitive to price. Therefore, in this project, I created a price elasticity model to predict what quantity can be sold by a burger joint given a range of prices and other conditions such as whether it's a holiday or not, what month and day is it, and whether or not it's a school break.

# How to use this project
Actually, I did this project to brush up on my analytical and TensorFlow skills. So, one thing to do is to improve my results, probably by doing feature crosses and providing more hidden layers to the model. In short, treat my model as a baseline, and improve on the result.

# Licensing, Author, Acknowledgements
I made this project for my selfish reasons above. If you can improve this, I will be glad to hear from you! Feel free to use/tweak this and mention me so I can take a look at your work.

As usual, I benefit greatly from Stackoverflow and ChatGPT. I won't be able to live without them :)
